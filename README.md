# Kata Fizz Buzz

The goal of FizzBuzz is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
However, for multiples of three, instead of the number, the program should print "Fizz". 
For multiples of five, instead of the number, the program should print "Buzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, the program should print "FizzBuzz".

To summarize, the program should produce the following output:
```text
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
...
```
